# Introduction

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 

# Assessment Using Reliability Demonstration Chart 

# Comparison of Results

# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed

Since the assignment consisted of two parts, we split into groups of two to complete each section of the assignment. Part one required running a program that could only run on Windows, so Muhammed and Topan took this task one since Muhammed had a Windows computer. Part two was analyzing the results from an Excel file so Gabe and Jacob worked on that section.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

A difficulty we encountered during this assignment was that the program required for part one only ran on Windows. This drastically slowed down our workflow since only certain people could work on one section.

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself

This lab was very difficult to do since setting up the environment was very buggy. The program in part one only runs on windows and only one member of our group was able to work on it.
