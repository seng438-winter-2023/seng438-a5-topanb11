# Introduction

The purpose of this lab is to analyze test data using reliability assessment tools using the following two methods: Reliability Growth Testing and Reliability Demonstration Chart (RDC). We will perform tests on a hypothetical system using SRTAT (Software Reliability Testing Analysis Tool) to measure the failure rate, MTTF and reliability of the SUT. The RDC will tell us if the failure rate or MTTF is met. 

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 

# Assessment Using Reliability Demonstration Chart 

# Comparison of Results

# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed

Since the assignment consisted of two parts, we split into groups of two to complete each section of the assignment. Part one required running a program that could only run on Windows, so Muhammed and Topan took this task one since Muhammed had a Windows computer. Part two was analyzing the results from an Excel file so Gabe and Jacob worked on that section.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

A difficulty we encountered during this assignment was that the program required for part one only ran on Windows. This drastically slowed down our workflow since only certain people could work on one section.

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself

This lab was very difficult to do since setting up the environment was very buggy. The program in part one only runs on windows and only one member of our group was able to work on it.
